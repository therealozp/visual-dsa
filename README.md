# The Last Data Structures Visualizer You Will Ever Need

## Description

**"the last data structures visualizer you will ever need"** (or tldsvuwen for short) is (or tries to be) exactly what is sounds like: a comprehensive web application designed to model, visualize, and interact with various data structures including graphs, trees, and linked lists. This tool aims to enhance the learning experience for beginners and advanced users alike by providing captivating visuals and intuitive interactions. With a suite of pathfinding algorithms and automated maze-generation for visualizations, **tldsvuwen** project hopes to make understanding complex data structures and algorithms both engaging and accessible.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Model and visualize graphs, trees, and linked lists with ease.
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Includes Dijkstra's, A*, and more to demonstrate algorithmic problem-solving.
- **Maze Generation (WIP):** Automated visualizations for demonstrating traversal techniques.
